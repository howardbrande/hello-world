Howie's first repository
I'm Howie, my greatest skills are the ability to relate a movie quote or Seinfeld episode to anything, leap across 8 lanes of traffic to pet a dog and eath cheeseburgers for a number of consecutive meals (6 is my record) 
I don't take myself or life too seriously. Often times if you can't laugh at something, you'll probably cry about it. I prefer to laugh.
